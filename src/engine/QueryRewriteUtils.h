// `filter` is a suitable GeoSPARQL filter with a variable on at least one side.
// Returns `nullptr` if `filter` is not such a filter. A side of the filter that

// `engine/filterFacts`) into its conjuncts. Then this conjunct can be rewritten
// on its own (e.g. to a `SpatialJoin`), and the other conjuncts are applied as
// regular FILTERs. A conjunct that is a fact only with the definitions of
// `group` (e.g. `geof:distance(?a, ?b) <= ?max` with `VALUES ?max { 500 }`) is
// replaced by an equivalent FILTER without them. A `LangIn` fact is applied to
// the triples of `group` (see `GraphPattern::addLanguageFilter`), which
// replaces its conjunct if this succeeds and the fact is exact.
//
// NOTE: If the fact is not exact (e.g. for different values of `?max` in
// different rows), the conjunct is kept in addition to this FILTER.
